    "In this notebook I'll detail my work using Waters proprietary software ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) v3.0.2 compare my MS^e spectral data against a protein sequence database to correlate predicted peptide fragmentation patterns with observed sample ions. While I can't run this tool from the commandline, screenshots will track the searches done and give a sense of the results generated.\n",

    "I am still peak-picking and refining by hand the watern column ETNP samples, but I have fresh ETNP sediment samples that I have accessed the chromatography of and am ready to process with PLGS. They are the Mayer sediment set, R1-R12. To search my spectral data against, I used the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) Combined Assembly Protein database (Rusch et al., 2007; Yooseph et al., 2007) from Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Marine Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis, CAMERA, downloaded on 29 September 2016.\n",
