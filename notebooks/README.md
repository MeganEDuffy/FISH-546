## Notebooks ##

The notebooks in this directory detail my work installing and running 2 main CLI tools: Novor and Unipept.


### Novor ####

[Novor](http://www.rapidnovor.com/) is a de novo peptide sequencing tool. Its algorthim deduces peptide sequences directly from observed MS/MS spectra, based solely on spacing between fragment ions that is consistent with specific amino acids.
Hence, there's no database required to search MS/MS spectra against to get protein matches.

### Unipept ###

[Unipept](http://unipept.ugent.be/) is a open source web application developed at Ghent University that is designed for metaproteomics data analysis with a focus on interactive datavisualizations.
Unipept is powered by an index containing all UniProt entries, a tweaked version of the NCBI taxonomy and a custom lowest common ancestor algorithm. This allows for biodiversity analysis of large and complex metaproteomic/metapeptidomic samples.
