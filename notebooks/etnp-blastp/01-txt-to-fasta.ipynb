    "To use Unipept commands ```pept2lca``` and ```pept2prot``` as seen in this project's [02-using-unipept](https://github.com/MeganEDuffy/FISH-546/blob/master/notebooks/etnp-unipept/02-using-unipept.ipynb) and [03-pept2prot](https://github.com/MeganEDuffy/FISH-546/blob/master/notebooks/etnp-unipept/03-pept2prot.ipynb) notebooks, I needed input to be a plain text file with a list of sequences peptides. This required trimming headers an extra columns from Novor's output cvs files. I extracted just the peptide column and trimmed headers using ```awk```, as seen in the [01-novor.sh notebook](https://github.com/MeganEDuffy/FISH-546/blob/master/notebooks/etnp-novor/01-novor.sh.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I want to blast these peptide sequences against NCBI's nonredudant protein database with ```blastp```. The input needs to be in FASTA format. I'll use [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) to do the conversion, so I can easily visualize the files as I go. This notebook will detail screengrabs showing the steps I used in the Galaxy platform."

I retained the first column as the descriptor name (following >), and since there's only one column, that means that the desciptors are just the peptide sequences themselves. I guess I could have used the Novor IDs from the CVS file, or even merge it with AA-score to keep more information in the fasta file. Not a bad idea for the future.\n",
