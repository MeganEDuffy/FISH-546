_This repository contains the analysis and data for my class project as part of FISH 546: Bioinformatics for Environmental Sciences (Fall 2016)._





_Week 3_: Become more familiar with the bioinformatics of proteomics. Search around publications and GitHub for quality availible tools that I can build into a pipeline going forward with my data. This week I found a helpful tutorial from [CompOmics](https://compomics.com/bioinformatics-for-proteomics/) that shed some light on the protein identification and functional ID work that I want to get at over the course of this project.
