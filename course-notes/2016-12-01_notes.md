###Bash scripting###
####December 1, 2016####

We're writing Bash scripts (.sh) for use in our projects. Sam Friedman is showing us some of his scripts

-for loops: 

```
for file in *.csv; do
      mv et cetera      
````

- ```awk``` calls rows "records" (R). 

- the ```echo ""``` line just prints a blank line between output lines

- ```IFS``` is the default Bash field separator. He changed ```IFS```, by doing ```IFS="_"``` but made a backup of it (```OIFS="$IFS"```). 
Then when using the command ```read```, the new field separator is used. Later he tuns it back to its original file ```IFS="$OIFS"```

- Bash is 0-based

- ```awk``` is 1-based

- ```$0``` prints all the contents of a file

- ```tee``` you can split output to two different places (i.e., you can print and print to a file after a pipe)
      
-  ```sed``` is a stream editor. Good for text replacement. 

- a good thing that Sam does: ```echo``` is used a lot

- another thing we can do: write in tests (checks) leveraging the exit status

- end an if statement using ```fi```
