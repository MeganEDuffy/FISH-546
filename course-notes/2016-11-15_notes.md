###Genome Browsers###

####Coordinate systems: looking at genome data####

What would we care about to look at in a genome broswer, and visualize:

1. where the genes are, their directionality
2. methylations
3. SNPs

####Alignment files####

SAM/BAM (BAM is binary - more compressed)
samtools has a crude genome browser embedded

bedtools:

1. intersectbed: is it flanking, do things intersect?

Integrated Genome Viewer:  

- Can run bedtools from this GUI
