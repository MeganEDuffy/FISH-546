    "[CoGe](https://genomevolution.org/coge/) is a browser-based platform for comparing, storing and visualizing genomic information and comparative analyses. From their [FAQ page](https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/FAQs#What_is_CoGe.3F), they list the four key goals of CoGe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store multiple versions of multiple genomes from multiple organism in a single platform\n",
    "2. Quickly find sequences of interest in genomes of interest (with associated information)\n",
    "3. Comparing multiple genomic regions using any algorithms \n",
    "4. Visualize the results of analyses in such a way as to make the identification of \"interesting\" patterns quick and easy.\n",

    "My goals for using CoGe for this project are to:\n",

    "1. Use CoGe to identify methylated sequences in my single osyter sample\n",
