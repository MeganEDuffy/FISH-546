### Data for this project ###

1. Sample collection

  Samples were collected in the ETNP at station 6 (see figure below) by _in situ_ filtering of approxmatly 10 L seawater onto 0.77 um glass fiber filters. Samples were frozen at -80 C until extraction. Samples are from the following depths:
  
 | Depth (m) |
 | --------- |
 |  55       |
 |  65       |
 |  100      |
 |  145      |
 |  160      |
 |  250      |
 |  2500     |
  
  
2. Protein extraction and trypic digestion

  Protein was extracted as detailed in Bridoux et al. **(2015)** _Journal of Marine Systems_; 143: 39-48
  Protein was quantified via Lowry assay.
  Samples were digested with sequence-grade trypsin (Promega) and desalted using a macrospin C18 column (NestGroup).

3. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry

  Dried, trypic peptides were suspended 5% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid and introduced into a Waters Xevo G2-S QTOF using a Waters Acquity nanoUPLC. 
  Peptide fragment spectra were collected by data-independent aquisition (MS^e) with low and elevated energy thresholds of 250 and 150 counts, respectively. 
  

4. Spectral Processing

  Raw MS<sup>e</sup> spectral data was imported into Protein Lynx Global Server ver 3.0.2 (Waters, 2016) as .RAW directories
  Raw data were processed with an intensity threshold of 750 counts and output as 'pseudo MS/MS' Masot Generic Format (.mgf) files
